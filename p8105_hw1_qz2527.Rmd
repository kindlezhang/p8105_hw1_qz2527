## Problem 1

```{r setup, include = FALSE}
library(moderndive)
```

1. load the data set

```{r load data}
data("early_january_weather")
```

2. describe the data

```{r describe data}
summary(early_january_weather)
# or use head(early_january_weather)
data_row = nrow(early_january_weather)
data_col = ncol(early_january_weather)
mean_temp = mean(early_january_weather$temp)
```

the variables in this data set are: `r ls(early_january_weather)`

the size of the data set is `r data_row` rows and `r data_col` columns

the mean temputure is `r mean_temp`
